TODO: Record a ~10 second GIF showing Claude Desktop answering "What's the hygiene rating for Dishoom in London?"
-->

## Quick Start

Add to your Claude Desktop config:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

### Option 1: Via PyPI (recommended)

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "food-hygiene": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["food-hygiene-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/w4sspr/food-hygiene-mcp.git
cd food-hygiene-mcp
uv sync
```

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "food-hygiene": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": ["run", "--directory", "/path/to/food-hygiene-mcp", "food-hygiene-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

> **Troubleshooting:** If you get `spawn uvx ENOENT` or `spawn uv ENOENT`, Claude Desktop can't find the executable. Use the full path instead (run `which uvx` or `which uv` to find it, e.g., `/Users/you/.local/bin/uvx`).

Restart Claude Desktop, then try:

> "What's the hygiene rating for Dishoom in London?"

## Example Prompts

- "What's the hygiene rating for Dishoom in London?"
- "Find restaurants in Manchester with at least a 4-star rating"
- "Show me takeaways in SW1A 1AA"
- "Get full inspection details for establishment 1662145"
- "Find cafes within 2 miles of 51.5074, -0.1278"

## Tools

### `search_establishments`

Search for food establishments by name, location, or rating.

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `name` | string | Business name (partial match) |
| `address` | string | Street or area |
| `postcode` | string | UK postcode |
| `latitude` | float | Latitude for geo-search |
| `longitude` | float | Longitude for geo-search |
| `radius_miles` | float | Max distance in miles (default: 1) |
| `business_type` | string | "restaurant", "takeaway", "pub", "cafe", "hotel", etc. |
| `min_rating` | int | Minimum hygiene rating (0-5) |
| `max_rating` | int | Maximum hygiene rating (0-5) |

### `get_establishment_details`

Get full details for a specific establishment by FHRS ID.

Returns: rating breakdown (hygiene, structural, confidence in management), inspection date, local authority info.

## Limitations

- **England, Wales, and Northern Ireland only** — Scotland uses a different system
- **No aggregate statistics** — can't calculate "% of 5-star restaurants" without fetching all data
- **Limited business types** — ~15 common types mapped; niche categories may not work
- **Geo-search requires coordinates** — city names alone won't trigger distance filtering

## Roadmap

- [ ] `get_local_authority_stats` — aggregate ratings by area (requires pagination through all establishments)
- [ ] Scotland support via FHIS API
- [ ] Cache business type mappings

## Why I Built This

Built to demonstrate MCP integration with UK public sector data for my FDE application.
